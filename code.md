### space is very imp for markdown 
## code blocks in markdown.
creating variables in MATHS `x=10`
# list

to create a list of variables in markdown we should follow some steps: 
- *backticks* [`]
1.  If we are using only one backtick [`] for a particular variable it will come in a single line. 
2.  in another case we're using 3 backticks like [```] by using space in a number line it will be in multiple lines.
-  for example given below:

```
ax+by+cz = r
x+2 = 5
2x+3y = zn
```
-------------------------------------------------
## sample variable in *java script*
```javascript
var x = 100;
var y = 200;
var z = x+y;
```
**variables in python language**
```python
var y = 200;
var x = 100;
var z = x+y;
```
